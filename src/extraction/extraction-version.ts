/**
 * Extraction version
 *
 * A monotonically-increasing integer that identifies the *shape and depth* of
 * what the extractor writes into the graph. Unlike `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
 * (which tracks the SQLite table layout and is migrated in place), this tracks
 * the EXTRACTED CONTENT — node kinds, edges, synthesizers, resolver coverage.
 *
 * When an index was built by an older engine whose `EXTRACTION_VERSION` is
 * below the running engine's, the data on disk is structurally fine but
 * *stale*: it's missing whatever a newer extractor would now produce. A schema
 * migration can't backfill that — only a re-index can. So this is the signal
 * `codegraph status` uses to recommend a re-index, and the reason `codegraph
 * upgrade` reminds users to refresh their projects.
 *
 * BUMP THIS when a release changes extraction output enough that existing
 * indexes should be rebuilt to benefit — e.g. a new language/framework
 * extractor, a new dynamic-dispatch synthesizer, a new node/edge kind, or a
 * resolver fix that materially changes which edges exist. Do NOT bump for
 * pure bug fixes, CLI/UX changes, or schema-only migrations. Over-bumping
 * turns the re-index hint into noise — keep it honest (see CLAUDE.md, "Honesty
 * in the product is load-bearing").

// v3: added Salesforce resolver — LWC/Aura JS → Apex method (@salesforce/apex import).
// v4: added Visualforce (.page/.component) extractor — page → controller/extensions/<c:comp>.
// v5: added LWC HTML template (lwc/*.html) extractor — template → <c-child> component.
// v6: added Aura (.cmp/.app/.evt/.intf) extractor + Aura JS handlers + cmp.get("c.x") → Apex.
// v7: (viva-local, never upstream) React→Apex postMessage bridge — remoteAction("Class.method").
